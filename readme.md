# Assignment 5 - Coding My Site

For this assignmentt you need to take your Figma design and code it exactly as it appears in the design.  I have provided you with all of the basic assets required from Figma in the repository.     

## Grading 
- You must show that you worked on this code step by step by having commits for the menu, hero section, featured section, about, buy, testimonial section, and footer.**

- All of the Playwright tests need to pass as well.

**You will gett a 0 if you do not have these requirements met and not be able to resubmit**

## Grading 
**You must show that you worked on this code step by step by having commits for the menu, hero section, featured section, about, buy, testimonial section, and footer.  If your assignment does not have the HTML and CSS for these sections in a commit, so that the HTML and CSS for that section can be easily reviewed your assignment will be given a 0 with  no resubmission.**

All of the Playwright tests need to pass as well.
